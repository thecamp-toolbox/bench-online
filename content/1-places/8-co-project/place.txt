A brain spa is a place where you go to get your neurons recharged. So many burnt-out creatives try to get their energy back by having their bodies worked on, and whilst this is nice (who doesn't like a long massage!, And yes we can arrange this too), it's often our brains that need the recharge through reflection, connection and creativity. 
The Brain Spa concept is about creating a space for regeneration of the mind as much as the body, in nature, with incredible people, nourishing food and the experiential learning to take back to your busy productive change-making life.
This is the UNSCHOOL'S CO PROJECT campus in sunny portugal : an experiment into rural regeneration, sustainability and creative change-making.
